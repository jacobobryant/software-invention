# Software invention sources

From [We need a career path for invention](https://rootsofprogress.org/a-career-path-for-invention):

> Broadly speaking, there are three domains of activity important to technological progress: science, invention, and business. Science discovers new knowledge; invention creates useful machines, chemicals, processes, or other products; and business produces and distributes these products in a scalable, self-sustaining way. ...
>
> The bottom line is that if a young person wants to focus their career on invention—as distinct from scientific research, corporate engineering, or entrepreneurship—the support structure doesn’t exist. There isn’t a straightforward way to get started, there isn’t an institution of any kind that will hire you into this role, and there isn’t a community that values what you are focused on and will reward you with prestige and further opportunities based on your success. In short, there is no career path.

This repository is meant to help build a community for software inventors. It is a directory of relevant content sources (RSS feeds, Twitter accounts, newsletters, anything that can be subscribed to). Sources are listed in the [open issues](https://github.com/jacobobryant/software-invention/issues). If you want to submit a source, create an issue. If we get lots of issues, I may start curating them.

You can subscribe to the issues by [RSS](https://rsshub.app/github/issue/jacobobryant/software-invention/all), by [Email](https://blogtrottr.com/?subscribe=https://rsshub.app/github/issue/jacobobryant/software-invention/all), or by simply watching the repository.
